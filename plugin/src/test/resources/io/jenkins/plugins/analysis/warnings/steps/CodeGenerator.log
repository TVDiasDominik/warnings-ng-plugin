Warning: Minimum '-1E+09' and maximum '1E+09' from 'S_data/K_data velocity to a/u_conv/b' are mapped to a portion of the wide signal coming from 'Out 1' of 'S_data/K_data velocity to a/u_conv/b' and have been ignored during range checking. To enable the range checking for the minimum and maximum values, insert a Signal Conversion block with its 'Output' parameter set to 'S_data/K_data velocity to a/u_conv/b'.
